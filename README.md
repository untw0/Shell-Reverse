### Reverse Shell:

A reverse shell is a technique commonly used in cybersecurity and hacking, in which an attacker (or hacker) establishes a reverse network connection from a compromised system (target) to a system controlled by the attacker. This allows the attacker to remotely control the compromised system, execute commands, manipulate files, and perform various actions on the system as if they were directly interacting with a local shell.

### C Code for CTF and Studies:

The code provided in this repository is an example of implementing a reverse shell server in C. It is suitable for studying CTF (Capture The Flag) practices and hacking, as it demonstrates how to create a reverse network connection and interact with the shell of a remote system.

This code is useful for understanding networking programming concepts, socket manipulation, system command execution, and interaction with the operating system shell in C. It can be used to enhance C programming skills as well as gain a better understanding of hacking techniques related to exploiting vulnerable systems.

### How to Put the Code into Practice:

To put the code into practice, follow these steps:

1. **Compiling the Code**: Save the code in a file with a `.c` extension, such as `reverse_shell_server.c`. Then, compile the code using a C compiler like `gcc`. Use the following command in the terminal:

    ```bash
    gcc reverse_shell_server.c -o reverse_shell_server
    ```

2. **Running the Server**: After successful compilation, execute the server with the following command:

    ```bash
    ./reverse_shell_server
    ```

3. **Client Connection**: Use a command-line tool like `netcat` (`nc`) to connect to the server. For example:

    ```bash
    nc <server_ip> <server_port>
    ```

4. **Interacting with the Shell**: Once the connection is established, you can send commands to the server. The output of the commands will be sent back to the client.

5. **Closing the Connection**: To terminate the connection, type `exit` or press `Ctrl+C` on the client.

By following these steps, you will be practicing the use of the provided code and understanding the concepts related to implementing a reverse shell in C.
